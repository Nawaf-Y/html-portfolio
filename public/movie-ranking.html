<h1><u>The Best Anime/Mangas According to Nawaf</u></h1>
<h2>My top Anime/Mangas of ALL TIME.</h2>

<h3><u>Hunter x Hunter</u></h3>
<p>This is hands down my favorite Manga and Anime series of all time. The way Togashi portrayed the similarities and differences of people within in the show was something I had never really seen and understood before in entertainment. Watching Gon lose his humanity on his way to do something everyone would consider humane and Mureum finding his humanity in something that would be consider extremely inhuman made one of the perfect contrast in anime history for me. Usually when characters are contrasted with each other they are either best friends or even mortal enemies who fight with each other but in HxH that just simply wasnt the case. Every character was individual and everyone had their own stories and lifes going on which was just as important as the rest, this is truly Togashi's greatest work in my humble opinion.  </p>

<h3><u>Jujutsu Kaisen</u></h3>
<p>This is my favorite for the more recent manga series out right now and of course my favorite character is Satoro Gojo aka Adult Killua. At first watching the show I thought it was just going to be like "Naruto" but when Gojo sparred Sukuna in the 2nd episode I knew this story was going to lead to something special. It really reminded me of the fight between Madara and Hirashima with 2 of the greatest from opposite sides clash together both alone in their world of having to be the greaest amongst their companions. The thing that kept me at the edge of my seat was how Gege Akutami would just kill some of the characters off when you wouldnt actually expect them to die in that moment. It made you question "did they really need to die ?", did they die to early ?". Gege Akutami's pacing really matched everything for me it made me realize what pacing i wanted for my own story if I were to ever make one. Last but definitely not least in my opinion in all the shonen manga I've read/watched there has never really been any well rounded female characters who arent confined to the typical women are weaker trope and that really made me love the story even more to the point where my favorite character is actually Maki Zenin. That is the definition of a strong, independant women, Gege Akutami really took my brain through the storm with this story.  </p>

<h3><u>Naruto series (Including shippuden)</u></h3>
<p>Ah "Naruto" the story that made me fall in love with anime to the point of no turning back, Naruto was the first anime that just felt relatable in the sense where it made me strive to be great at such a young age. The complexity of the characters really opened my eyes to how certain things have to be done in order for certain things to progress, growing up hearing about itachi I was lead to believe that he was this evil menace with no heart who just took a liking to killing. I was wrong because once "Shippuden" was released and Itachi became a big central part for the story it should me how well his character truly was. I was under the impression that he was just a normal anime "badguy" but when his story ended and I realized he was the stories 'divine intervention' he was like a prophet that was sent to correct certain things so that the people in his brother and his village could survive and live to see the future he knew they capable of creating. This is one of my very first animes that I genuinely loved, the story of Naruto Uzamaki truly resonated with me from such a young age and I honestly would recommend starting here if I wanted anyone to get into Anime.</p>
