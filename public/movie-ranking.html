<h1>The Best Anime/Mangas According to Nawaf</h1>
<h2>My top Anime/Mangas of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Hunter X Hunter</h3>
<p>This is hands down my favorite Manga and Anime series of all time.</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>This is my favorite for the more recent manga series out right now and of course my favorite character is Satoro Gojo aka Adult Killua.</p>
<h3>Naruto series (Including shippuden)</h3>
<p>This is one of my very first animes that I genuinly loved, The story of Naruto Uzamaki truly resonated with me from such a young age and I honestly would recommend starting here if I wanted anyone to get into Anime.</p>
<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>This is one of the only anime movies that I believe should have one an award for best movie.</p>
<h3>The Promised Neverland</h3>
<p>Very mind-bending plot that will have you on the edge of your seat every single episode wondering whats going to happen next.</p>
<h3>Classroom of the Elite</h3>
<p>A psychological thriller that really made me question the capabilities of the human mind</p>
